Once upon a time, in a peaceful village nestled between the mountains, there lived a wise old teacher. She often spoke about a powerful force that guided everything in life—this force was called ‘Karma.’

Karma, she explained, is like a mirror of our actions. Everything we do—whether it’s a kind gesture or an unkind one—comes back to us, like ripples in a pond. If we plant good seeds, we grow beautiful flowers. But if we plant bad seeds, we get weeds.

Imagine you help someone by giving them food when they’re hungry. That kindness is like planting a good seed, and soon, good things start happening to you. Maybe someone helps you when you need it most, or you just feel happier inside.

On the other hand, if you’re mean to someone or hurt them, that’s like planting a bad seed. Over time, those bad actions can grow into problems that come back into your life, causing stress or unhappiness.

The law of Karma teaches us that we are responsible for what we put into the world. Every action has a reaction—like a boomerang, it comes back to us.

But here’s the good news! Karma also gives us a chance to learn and grow. If we’ve made mistakes, we can choose to act with kindness, compassion, and love from today. By planting more good seeds, we can create a life full of joy and peace.

So remember, every small action matters. When we live with good intentions and help others, we make the world—and our own lives—a little brighter.

That is the simple beauty of the Law of Karma.
